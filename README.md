# SellerControl
This program facilitates the fusion of sales reports from Amazon and MercadoLibre. Its aim is to serve for the restock process.

An Excel file is generated based on the information provided by reports from:

* Teikametrics: `Teikametrics -> Product catalog -> Select dates -> Export`.
* MercadoLibre: `MercadoLibre -> Publicaciones -> GestiÃ³n de stock Full -> Descargar reportes de stock -> Reporte general de stock`.

## To-do

- [ ] Add option to change the months of sales to predict and the range of dates from the reports.
- [ ] Optimize and simplify the code for file generation.
- [ ] Work on the design of the webpage.
